Hi, I am trying to make this file run on my computer but it keeps giving me the error that:
$ python test_script.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\faris\OneDrive\Documents\guitar project\test_script.py", line 7, in <module>
    from tuner_audio.audio_analyzer import AudioAnalyzer
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tuner_audio'


from line 7 to 16 there seems to be an error (these lines): 
from tuner_audio.audio_analyzer import AudioAnalyzer
from tuner_audio.threading_helper import ProtectedList
from tuner_audio.sound_thread import SoundThread

from tuner_appearance_manager.color_manager import ColorManager
from tuner_appearance_manager.image_manager import ImageManager
from tuner_appearance_manager.timing import Timer

from tuner_ui_parts.main_frame import MainFrame
from tuner_ui_parts.settings_frame import SettingsFrame


I would appreciate it if you could help me out and tell me what I am doing wrong
