Hey man! I am sooo glad I found this project because I have been trying to make something similar for my scholarship project. 
My project is making a guitar trainer app. One of the components was going to be the tuner, but I didn't have anything to learn from or base my project on. 
But thankfully I found your! I just have a question. The second componenet is making like a guitar hero type thing. So basically a treadmill that has guitar notes/chords on it. 
I want to make it so that when the player plays the note/chord, the tuner to recognize it and then store the info to say if it was right or wrong. And the final version if I have 
time I would like to make it light up green or read based on the result. I wanted to ask if you had any tips for me? 
I appreciate it, 
Wahid
